  <h1>
  <p> A Thunder-Storm</p>
  </h1>

  <h3>
  <p>By: Emily Dickinson</p>
  </h3>
  <h5>
    <em class="partone">The wind begun to rock the grass </em><br>
    <em class="partwo">With threatening tunes and low,
   — He </em> <em class="flung">flung</em> <em> a menace at the earth, A menace at the sky.</em>

    <br>
    <em class="parthree">The leaves unhooked themselves from trees And started all abroad;
    The dust did scoop itself like hands And throw away the road. </em><br>

    <em class="partfour">The wagons quickened on the streets, The thunder hurried slow;
    The lightning showed a yellow beak,<br>
    <em class="partfive">And then a <em class="livid">livid</em> claw.
    The birds put up the bars to nests, The cattle fled to barns;
    There came one drop of giant rain,</em> <br>
    <em class="a">And then,</em>
    <br>
    <em class="partsix">as if the hands
    That held the dams had parted hold, The waters wrecked the sky,
     But overlooked my father’s house,</em> <br> <br>
    <em class="tree">Just quartering a tree.
   </em>
